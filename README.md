The Girls Coode project began as an initiative to introduce and attract women to the technology area with a focus on programming, 
initiated by IT students from Senac – Salto: Jasanias Tadeu, Júlia Dias, Letícia Schiffel and Mariana Pinheiro.

Girls Coode, aims to introduce the world and the wonders of programming to women, as it is mostly a male area, 
over time the technological market realized the need for female integration in the field, and the Girls Coode project emerges as a way to speed up this process.
